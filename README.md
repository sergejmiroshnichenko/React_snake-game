__Implemented the famous 'Snake' game :__
1) snake movement - right, left, up, down, which is done from the keyboard with the arrows. 
2) pause the game - start/stop button
3) food appears randomly
4) when you reach 5 points, snake's movement speed increases
5) The game ends and a modal window appears with information about points earned when the head collides with the snake's body.
