__Implemented the famous 'Snake' game :__
1) game registration.
2) snake movement - right, left, up, down, which is done from the keyboard with the arrows. 
3) pause the game - start/stop button
4) food appears randomly
5) when you reach 5 points, snake's movement speed increases
6) the game ends and a modal window appears with information about points earned when the head collides with the snake's body.
